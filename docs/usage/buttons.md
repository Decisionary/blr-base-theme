# Buttons

BLR Base Theme allows for buttons in both <button> and <a> forms.  Regardless of which method you pick, the buttons should appear identical, giving you flexibility in implementation.

## Button
To use the button styling for the <button> html elements, simply create a button element and assign it one of the classes below.

## Links
To use button styling for a link, apply the 'button' class as well as one of the classes below to control the colors of the button.

## Button Variants
Buttons come in the following forms:
- Default (uses the site primary color for its states.  This is applied to <button> elements with no class, and to links that have only the button class.)
- Alert (using the alert class.  Uses $brand-warning as its color.)
- Info (using the info class. Uses $brand-info as its color.)
- Success (using the success class.  Uses $brand-success as its color.)
- Error (using the error class.  Uses $brand-danger as its color.)
